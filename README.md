# predicting-stackoverflow-tags
Hello there! I'm excited to introduce you to our Stack Overflow question tagging model. 
With the power of advanced NLP techniques, I've built a model that predicts tags for Stack 
Overflow questions, simplifying the process of categorization and making questions easier 
to discover. I used the dataset available at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/stackoverflow/stackoverflow for training and testing. 
If you're interested in the inner workings, you can dive into the model's details through the 
notebook on Kaggle available at https://www.kaggle.com/code/priyabrataaa/predicting-stackoverflow-tags/notebook. 
And if you'd like to give it a try yourself, you can download the 'APP' 
folder, run 'app.py,' and access the web interface at https://127.0.0.1:5000 in your 
browser to experience the model firsthand.
